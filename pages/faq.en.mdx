## How to Add Liquidity on DEX

ZooKeeper partnered with several Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) in order to provide the dApp with liquidity from Liquidity Providers (LPs).

On Avalanche network, both Trader Joe and Pangolin are available while on Wanchain, Wanswap is the exclusive one. On top of allowing users to trade $ZOO tokens, the basic trading functionality of each DEX comes directly from the Uniswap codebase: LPs are incentivized for providing liquidity to trading pairs with rewards drawn from the fees paid by users swapping between the paired assets.

On each of these DEXes, at least one $ZOO pair is available to LPs. After providing liquidity, LPs receive DEX LP tokens. These tokens represent their shares in the pool and will be used to withdraw funds or in the yield farm.

## DEX LP Tokens

When you supply liquidity to a DEX liquidity pool, you receive DEX LP tokens in proportion to the amount you supply. When a trade is facilitated by the pool a percentage of the fee is proportionally distributed amongst all the liquidity pools token holders. If you withdraw your assets from the pool, you will receive the earned fees but your tokens will be burned.

## Compatible Wallets

ZooKeeper platform is compatible with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) (desktop & mobile) on both Avalanche and Wanchain networks. [WanMask](https://wanmask.io/) (desktop) and [WanWallet](https://wanchain.org/getstarted) (desktop & mobile) are other options for Wanchain users only.

## Tokenomics

ZooKeeper uses a Dynamic Market Cap strategy as a result of the burning of ZOO tokens and the use of NFT Boosts within its farming environment.

The distribution of ZOO tokens is spread over 24 months at the rate of 10 ZOO per block. There will never be any form of pre-mining or pre-sale of ZOO tokens. 

<span style={{textDecoration:'underline'}}>Token Allocation Breakdown</span>:

<div style={{fontSize:16,marginLeft:30,marginTop:20}}>
<div>77% will be reserved for the farming pools and is subject to the dynamic calculation below</div>
<div>9% will be kept for the ZooKeeper foundation</div>
<div>8% will be dedicated to marketing</div>
<div>3% will be reserved for advisors</div>
<div>3% will be used to purchase wanTokens chosen by the community</div>
</div>

Because $ZOO has a dynamic market cap, we cannot provide an exact market cap figure due to the boost % from NFTs applied to pools and the lockup period used by users; These are all unknown variables until confirmed the point of application.  Therefore, we have a Minimum and a Maximum market cap.  It's impossible that either of these market caps will be the case at the end of the 24 months, and the final market cap will be somewhere in between. 

* Min $ZOO: 155,157,120
* Max $ZOO: 393,059,532.10

To see how these figures are calculated, we have published a detailed post on our [official Medium channel](https://medium.com/zookeeper-blog/dynamic-market-cap-734390926c12)

                <td align="left" valign="top">When you provide liquidity in for example, the WASP/WAN pool.  
                    You get WSLP tokens that represent your portion of the liquidity pool.
                    You would (pre Zookeeper) only be able to use these tokens to farm WASP, but now you will be able to use those same WSLP tokens in the ZooKeeper dApp.  
                    So instead of farming in WASP, you can dual farm in ZOO and WASP instead.  
                    Dual farming is only on specified pools but WAN/WASP is a dual farming pool at time of writing this.
