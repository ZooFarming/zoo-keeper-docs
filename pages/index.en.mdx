# What is ZooKeeper?

[ZooKeeper](https://www.zookeeper.finance/) is an innovative multi-chain dApp, currently available on Avalanche and Wanchain, which uses ZooNFTs to boost liquidity mining.

ZooKeeper was created in order to fuel the ZooEcosystem with liquidity. It brings you a new and interesting farming experience, leading you to experience higher mining rewards and richer and more interesting NFT gameplay.

With the thought of maximizing commitment from our community, we introduced ZOONFTs which have unique use cases in the blockchain world by enhancing LP Farming.

Zookeeper has its own utility token ($ZOO) distributed as farming rewards to DEX Liquidity Providers (LPs), who stake their LP tokens, as well as a wrapped version (vZOO) used for cross chain.

All this makes ZooKeeper a unique gamified yield farming Dapp with profit potential and gaming fun.
