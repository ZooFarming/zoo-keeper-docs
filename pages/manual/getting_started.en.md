Before you start, you'll need to:

1. Download and install MetaMask wallet (Desktop/Mobile). While other wallets such as WalletConnect, WanWallet (Wanchain only) and WanMask (Wanchain only) are also compatible, the recommended wallet to use is MetaMask. 

2. Set up MetaMask wallet with the preferred network to connect to ZooKeeper.

Once you have a compatible wallet and DEX LP tokens (check the [FAQ](/faq#how-to-add-liquidity) on how to provide liquidity on Decentralized Exchanges), you can get busy farming and have some fun while doing it too.
