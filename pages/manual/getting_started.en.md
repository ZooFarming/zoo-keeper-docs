# Getting Started

![](/availableon.png)

Before you start, you'll need one of the three wallets ZooKeeper supports:

*   WanMask (Desktop)
*   Wanwallet (Desktop/Mobile)
*   MetaMask (Desktop/Mobile)

Once you have a compatible wallet and WSLP tokens (check the [FAQ](/faq#how-to-add-liquidity) on how to provide liquidity on WanSwap), you can get busy farming and have some fun while doing it too.
