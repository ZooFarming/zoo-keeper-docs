## ZOO Burning
![](/docs/image2.png)

ZooKeeper has multiple burn mechanisms:  
- Every time a chest is purchased.  For example, if you buy a chest for 5000 $ZOO, the burning mechanism will immediately incinerate those 5000 $ZOO tokens.
- When a NFT is bought in The Market, 1% of the set price is added to the burn, no matter the currency.
- When an NFT is transferred from one wallet to another using the Transfer feature in My Safe. 1% of the last sale price of a similar token sold on the market is charged as a fee.  If no fee exists, 1 ZOO will be the price of the transaction.
