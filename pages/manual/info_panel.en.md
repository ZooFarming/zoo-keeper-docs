This section simply displays a brief description of the distribution, market cap and value of the $ZOO token.

## ZOO Burning

ZooKeeper has a burn mechanism.  The burn happens every time a chest is purchased.  For example, if you buy a chest for 5000 $ZOO, the burning mechanism will immediately incinerate those 5000 $ZOO tokens.
