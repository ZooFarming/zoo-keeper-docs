This section simply displays a brief description of the distribution, market cap and value of the $ZOO token.

## ZOO Burning
![](/docs/image2.png)

ZooKeeper has a burn mechanism.  The burn happens every time a chest is purchased.  For example, if you buy a chest for 5000 $ZOO, the burning mechanism will immediately incinerate those 5000 $ZOO tokens. Another burn mechanism has been implemented in The Market section: when a NFT is bought, 1% of the set price is added to the burn, no matter the currency.
