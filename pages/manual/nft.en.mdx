# ZooKeeper NFT Information
ZooKeeper NFT's are defined by many key features.  Each minted NFT will have its own individual characteristics.
ZOONFT’s are currently split into two distinct groups:

## ZooBoosters

ZooBoosters are primarily known for improving your ZOO rewards when added to a farming pool, but also for being tradable in The Market or used in ZooRena battles. The percentage (%) boost and locktime reducer linked to each of these ZooBoosters represent their farming abilities.
Some may be the same as others, and some will vary.  For example, no two “Sweet Scented Orange” will be the same:

As you can see from the above, the boosting impact and the locktime reducing impact are different.  Even on the off chance that these should be the same, each NFT will have its individual issue number, making it unique.

When NFTs are minted, the key features which define them will not change.  Boosting and time percentages will not change at any time.

## Level

Levels will make more sense when crafting becomes available. Crafting will provide a mechanism to be able to combine 2 NFTs to create one.  An example of this would be 2 x Apples (2 x 1 stars) = 1 x Apple Juice (1 x 2 star).  This will be possible upto a maximum of 4 levels (One Star, Two Star, Three Star and Max).  More details on this will be provided closer to release time. 

This is the original vision of ZooKeeper team in regards to the level system; more developments will be implemented in the future and changes can be made to the mechanics of this section.

## Keepsakes

KeepSakes functionalities are meant to be different from what ZooBoosters have to offer. Keepsakes will have different individual attributes connected to their respective categories such as art, utility, collectibles, etc.

Keepsakes could for example be earned by completing a special task or by participating in some activities related to ZooKeeper or even with another related dApp. There are infinite possibilities to expand a Keepsake portfolio.

When initially viewing a Keepsake, the category will be visible alongside the project with which the Keepsake is associated. When hovering over it, the flipside will reveal a brief description and its function.
