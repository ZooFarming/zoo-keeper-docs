# NFT Bridge

ZOONFT Bridge is a feature available for use with all ZooNFTs (ZooBoosters and ZooElixirs) on ZooKeeper. The option appears in the MySafe section and will display all available networks in the next window.

Users can easily cross chain their ZOONFTs from chain to chain:

* Select origin and destination networks
* Input sending and receiving addresses for each network (Note that several networks can use the same address)
* Select the NFT they would like to cross-chain from the list
* Tick the disclaimer box and make sure all details are correct
* Confirm sending transaction
* Confirm receiving item on receiving chain with pop up window

Once transferred, ZOONFTs have the same function and can be used on the different chain for farming, trading, etc...
