The user has the possibility of earning chests by either buying them directly using ZOO tokens, or by locking these ZOO tokens. A gold chest will automatically provide the user with an NFT while a silver chest will only give a 1 in 10 chance. All purchased chests automatically burn the ZOO tokens used.
